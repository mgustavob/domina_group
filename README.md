### My brothers letter

Hello my name is David Briceno and I am the owner of 'Domina Group',a tutoring company that helps school and university student.

I am tasking my brother, Martin Briceno, to help me with a website for my company (I do have a webside 'http://www.elgrupodomina.com/', but I will like an upgrade)... here is what I ask him to help me with:

    1. An upgrade from the original site, more interaction
    2. A way to login for Tutors and Students
    3. Me, and only me (the superuser) will have the power to make a student a Tutor
    4. Tutor will be able to select from a list of subjects they teach, if the subject they teach is not there, they will be able to create one
    5. Students can select subjects previously created but they cant create or delete subjects
    6. The ability to create an appointment
